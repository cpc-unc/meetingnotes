# Meeting notes for the Competitive Programming Club at UNC Chapel Hill

Hello everyone!

This is a repository that holds a collection of all notes from meetings of the Competitive Programming Club (CPC) at UNC.

The CPC serves to guide prospective programmers into the preparation for one of the most prestigious programming competitions: ICPC (International collegiate programming contest). This student-led club provides a way to provide resources and guidance for ICPC - to, from, and by UNC students.

Aside from help and resources to get better at solving programming problems and advancing in the competition, learning these sorts of problems is also extremely beneficial for sharpening your problem-solving skills for problems seen in interview questions as well. The CPC is a collaborative, guided environment where you give and receive help to/from other students, who are all collectively working together to become better programmers.

Additionally, we have exciting news: there's also a chance we could host the ICPC regionals right here at UNC! If you're interested, please join our [HeelLife page](https://heellife.unc.edu/organization/competitiveprogrammingclub), and our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/uncicpc/shared_invite/zt-1i2ntuzms-6GhZ9rNyqPT3munQTd_Vgg), in which all of our communication will happen.

Come join us at our meetings on every alternate Monday at 5:45 PM in Sitterson 014!
